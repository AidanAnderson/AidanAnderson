- 👋 Hi, I’m @AidanAnderson - 3rd year Software Engineering at McMaster University
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Data Analytics and Data Visualization


- 🐍  The majority of my projects will use Python right now that includes: 
  - 🃏  Analyzing Board Games that I enjoy until noone will play with me anymore 😅
  - 🏫  School Assignments that I have completed 

- 📚 Currently reading "Analytical Skills for AI & Data Science by Daniel Vaughan"
- Expect to see some repos where I work through implementing Algorithms as a part of my degree
  (Linear Algebra, Statistics, and maybe more!)
  
  Right now I have no socials however that may change in the future!
